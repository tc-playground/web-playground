# Redux Thunk

## Introduction

* `redux-thunk` should be used whenever we create an `asynchronous action creator`.

* `redux thunk` relaxes the rules on `Action creators` to allow them to return an `action object` **OR** a `function` that calls a provided `dispatch` method to return an `action object`.

* If a `function` is returned by an `Action creator`; `redux-thunk` will automatically invoke it with the `dispatch` and `getState` functions.

* `redux-thunk` allows you to manually `dispatch()` a (new) `action`.

* `redux-thunk` middleware can help make `async requests` in a redux application. Once the result is returned, it can `dispatch` the result as an `action object`.

* `redux-thunk` is an npm library:

  - **Install** - `npm install --save redux thunk

* `redux-thunk` alternatives include `redux-promise` and `redux-saga`.
