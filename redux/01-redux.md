# Redux

## Introduction

* `Redux` is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

* `Redux` is an __architectural pattern__. It is theoretically not `React` or `JavaScript` specific.

* `redux` is an npm JavaScript library for Redux.

    * __Install__ - `npm install --save redux`

## [Redux Store](https://redux.js.org/basics/store)

* In `Redux`, there is a single `store` that holds the whole application state.

* In `React-Redux`, the `props` for a component are defined in `mapStateToProps`.

## Redux Cycle

```
[Action Creator] -> [Action] -> [Dispatch] -> [Reducers] -> [State (store)] ... action creators
```

1. __`Action Creator`__ - The entity (function) that creates the `action`, for example, a web page component, or, function.

    * `Action creators` are the __only way to change state__ in a `redux` app.


2. __`Action`__ - A type of event that consists of a `type` and `payload`.
    
    * __`Type`__ - This is used in a `reducer` to process the `payload`. It is the operation to be performed.

    * __`Payload`__ - The data to be used in the operation.


3. __`Dispatch`__ - A special `dispatch` __function++ that wraps a set of `reducers` and sends a copy of the incoming `action` to all of them.


4. __`Reducer`__ - A big switch statement. A reducer takes an `action payload` and performs operation based on the `action type`.

    * `combineReducers()` - is used to combine a collection of `reducer functions`.


5. __`State` (Redux Store)__ - The state (the `redux store`) is updated with the result of the `reducer`.

    * `createStore()` is used to create the initial store.

    * `state` can only ever be changed through the `Action creator`, `action`, `dispatch`, `state` flow.

    * >NB: It using `react` this will render any components that have changed.
